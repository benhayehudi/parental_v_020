# Parental
## v0.1.0
## Ben Greenberg

Parental is a Ruby on Rails todo application for parents and caregivers to organize the items they need to get done. Users can create accounts, either through a registration page or by signing in through Facebook. Once registered, users are able to create TODO lists and add specific Tasks to each TODO list. Both a TODO list and a specific Task can be marked "done" and the app provides directions to where you need to go through the Google Maps API. Users will receive auto-generated reminder emails for a TODO within 2 days of it's due date.

To access the app visit http://www.parental.life.
